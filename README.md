# PLATYPUS Compiler Project
Front end of a compiler built to process a custom computer language for a course at Algonquin College.

##Introduction
During the course of a semester at Algonquin college in the CST8152 Compilers class, I built the front end of a compiler to process a custom language designed by our professor Svillen Ranev. This was a project in which I learnt about and applied knowledge associated with:
  - Programming in C for a large-scale project.
  - Natural language processing.
  - Dynamic, adaptable data structures (buffers)
  - Token generation from character analysis (scanner)
  - Creation and indexing of metadata for a computer program (symbol table)
  - Analysis and categorization of series of tokens into a set grammar (parser)
